Personal dotfiles for macOS, configured for my daily workflow.  
Feel free to use them as inspiration for your own setup.

> [!NOTE]  
> These dotfiles are tailored for my personal use. They may need adjustments to work for your environment.

## üìö Essential knowledge

## üöÄ Install

Before being able to clone the repo, we first need to setup git.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

Next, clone this repository. Personal preference is to clone this into a directory representing the github user name.

```sh
mkdir -p $HOME/jorgenkrieger
git clone https://github.com/JorgenKrieger/dotfiles.git $HOME/jorgenkrieger/dotfiles
cd $HOME/jorgenkrieger/dotfiles
git submodule update --init --recursive
./dotfiles
```

After cloning the repo, run the install scripts.
